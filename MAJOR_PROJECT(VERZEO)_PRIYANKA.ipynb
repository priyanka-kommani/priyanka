Twitter Sentiment Analysis, therefore means, using advanced text mining techniques to analyze the sentiment of the text (here, tweet) in the form of positive, negative and neutral. It is also known as Opinion Mining, is primarily for analyzing conversations, opinions, and sharing of views (all in the form of tweets) for deciding business strategy, political analysis, and also for assessing public actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Twitter sentiment analysis allows you to keep track of what's being said about your product or service on social media, and can help you detect angry customers or negative mentions before they escalate.\n",
        "\n",
        "* For e.g.: if a tweet has 4 positive, 2 neutral and, 2 negative words, then the sentiment of the tweet will be calculated as: Thus, the tweet would be marked as positive as it has more positive dominant words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### We follow these 3 major steps in our program:\n",
        "1.Authorize twitter API client.\n",
        "2.Make a GET request to Twitter API to fetch tweets for a particular query.\n",
        "3.Parse the tweets. Classify each tweet as positive, negative or neutral.\n",
        "## Why we use Twitter sentiment analysis :\n",
        "* Sentiment analysis tools are essential to detect and understand customer feelings. Companies that use these tools to understand how customers feel can use it to improve CX. Sentiment analysis tools generate insights into how companies can enhance the customer experience and improve customer service.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The XGBoost and Naive Bayes algorithms were tied for the highest accuracy of the 12 twitter sentiment analysis approaches tested.\n",
        "\n",
        "* These artificially intelligent bots are trained on millions of pieces of text to detect if a message is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis works by breaking a message down into topic chunks and then assigning a sentiment score to each topic\n",
        "\n",
        "* Counts the number of positive and negative words that appear in a given text. If the number of positive word appearances is greater than the number of negative word appearances, the system returns a positive sentiment, and vice versa. If the numbers are even, the system will return a neutral sentiment\n",

        "**It is a technique widely used in text mining.sentiment analysis provides a more precise level of polarity by breaking it down into further categories, usually very positive to very negative. This can be considered the opinion equivalent of ratings on a 5-star scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Emotion detection identifies specific emotions rather than positivity and negativity. Examples could include happiness, frustration, shock, anger and sadness.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Intent-based analysis recognizes actions behind a text in addition to opinion. For example, an online comment expressing frustration about changing a battery could prompt customer service to reach out to resolve that specific issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Aspect-based analysis gathers the specific component being positively or negatively mentioned. For example, a customer might leave a review on a product saying the battery life was too short. Then, the system will return that the negative sentiment is not about the product as a whole, but about the battery life.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications of sentiment analysis\n",
        "Sentiment analysis tools can be used by organizations for a variety of applications, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Identifying brand awareness, reputation and popularity at a specific moment or over time.\n",
        "* Tracking consumer reception of new products or features.\n",

        "* Collecting customer feedback from social media, websites or online forms.\n",
        "* Conducting market research.\n",
        "* Categorizing customer service requests.\n",
        "* Challenges with sentiment analysis\n",
        "* Challenges associated with sentiment analysis typically revolve around inaccuracies in training models. Objectivity, or comments with a neutral sentiment, tend to pose a problem for systems and are often misidentified. For example, if a customer received the wrong color item and submitted a comment \"The product was blue,\" this would be identified as neutral when in fact it should be negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment can also be challenging to identify when systems cannot understand the context or tone. Answers to polls or survey questions like \"nothing\" or \"everything\" are hard to categorize when the context is not given, as they could be labeled as positive or negative depending on the question. Similarly, irony and sarcasm often cannot be explicitly trained and lead to falsely labeled sentiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computer programs also have trouble when encountering emojis and irrelevant information. Special attention needs to be given to training models with emojis and neutral data so as to not improperly flag texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, people can be contradictory in their statements. Most reviews will have both positive and negative comments, which is somewhat manageable by analyzing sentences one at a time. However, the more informal the medium, the more likely people are to combine different opinions in the same sentence and the more difficult it will be for a computer to parse."
